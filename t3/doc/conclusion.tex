\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We conclude that the envelope detector and voltage regulator circuit form an effective AC/DC transformer, which was the objective outlined in the laboratory assignment. Through experimentation, it was possible to come to a result that achieves satisfactory DC output at a reasonable cost, a compromise which is an essential part of engineering.

Without the imposed restriction of the n:1 transformer between the AC input and the envelope detector (or with n $>$ 1), it would be possible to achieve significantly larger merit values, as the voltage ripple would become extremely small. Such a solution was disregarded per the objectives of the assignment.
