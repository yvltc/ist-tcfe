\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Looking at the results shown in table \ref{op:tab_4} and comparing them to the theoretical analysis present in tables \ref{tab_2} and \ref{tab_3}, it is clear that the \emph{NgSpice} simulation results were equal to the values predicted by the methods applied. As the "experimental" results are merely a simulation based on the same theoretical models used in this report, it is not surprising that this is the case. The circuit is comprised of only linear components (current and voltage sources and resistors), as such no symbolic calculations were required in a mathematical software like \emph{Octave}. This contributes as well to the exact correspondence between simulation and theoretical results.
