\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

To conclude, the values obtained from both the theoretical and the simulation analysis were, in general, similar, with most of the objectives achieved, namely the gain of 40 dB and the central frequency of 1 kHz. The value of the merit is very low because of the high cost, which is mostly due to the OP-AMP circuit components.

Regarding the physical laboratory class, while it did provide valuable insight for the assignment and the course in general, it would perhaps be better if it were closer to the date of the assignment, so as to already have some kind of comparison with the theoretical models.
