\section{Simulation Analysis Using \emph{NgSpice}}
\label{sec:simulation}

\subsection{Operating point for $t<0$}
\label{sec:3.1}
Table \ref{op:tab_4} shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit under analysis when t$<$0s. It is possible to see that table \ref{op:tab_4} shows the current that goes through all the resistors as well as the voltage in each node. 


However, as we can see there is an additional node when compared to the number of nodes that the circuit truly has. Since the circuit has a current-controlled voltage source, in order to be able to define this component in the \emph{NgSpice} netlist, a current value that goes through another voltage source is required. However, in this circuit, this current value must be the same that goes through the resistor $R_6$. Therefore, an additional voltage source, $V_{aux}$, was added to the circuit between $R_6$ and $R_7$ with voltage equal to 0V, DC. Thus, this additional voltage source will have the same current that goes through $R_6$. A new node 4 that connects $R_6$ to $V_{aux}$, is created. Accordingly, node 7 will connect $V_{aux}$ to $R_7$.\\

\subsection{Operating point for $V_s=0$}
\label{sec:3.2}

Table \ref{op:tab_5} shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit under analysis when $V_s=0$. Furthermore, the capacitor was replaced with an independent voltage source $V_x=V(6)-V(8)$, where $V(6)$ and $V(8)$ are the voltages of the nodes obtained in section \ref{sec:3.1}. This change was due to the same reason as explained in section \ref{sec2.2}.
The values obtained were the following:

\subsection{Natural response of the circuit}
\label{sec:3.3}

In this section the natural response of the circuit is obtained and the result using a transient analysis from 0 to 20ms is presented in figure \ref{transv6}. In order to produce the results, some initial conditions were imposed such as $V_6$ and $V_8$ need to have the same values obtained in \ref{sec:3.2} and presented in \ref{op:tab_5}. However, in order to be easier to program, the group decided to use values obtained from \emph{Octave} since the values were equal to the ones obtained in \emph{Ngspice}. Furthermore, $V_s$ was considered to be an independent voltage source, with direct current (DC) and value equal to 0V.

It is possible to see that the plot obtained is very similar to the one obtained in the theoretical analysis, in section \ref{sec2.3} Figure \ref{fig2}.

\subsection{Total response of the circuit}
\label{sec:3.4}

While in \ref{sec:3.3} the natural response of the circuit was obtained while defining $V_s$ a DC voltage equal to 0V, in this section $V_s$ is defined as a sinusoidal wave accordingly to \ref{fig7}.
Therefore, a transient analysis was executed in order to simulate the total response obtained in $V_6$ and the stimulus $V_s$. The plot obtained is shown in figure \ref{totalresponse}.

\subsection{Frequency response of the circuit}
\label{sec:3.5}

In this section, the frequency response for node $V_6$, voltage source $V_s$ and capacitor $V_c$ is simulated for a frequency range from 0.1Hz to 1MHz. The plot obtained from this analysis is shown in figure \ref{frequencyresponse}. The frequency is presented in logarithmic scale and the values of the magnitude are presented in decibel. 

\begin{figure}[!htp] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.40\textwidth]{frequencyresponse.pdf}
\captionsetup{justification=centering, margin=2cm}
\caption{Frequency response for node $V_6$, voltage source $V_s$ and capacitor $V_c$ (dB) in respect to frequency from 0.1 Hz to 1MHz (logarithm scale)}
\label{frequencyresponse}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

Comparing the plot obtained and the plot obtained from the theoretical analyis, Figure \ref{fig5} it is possible to see that both plots are identical.

Furthermore, the phases for node $V_6$, voltage source $V_s$ and capacitor $V_c$ are also simulated and presented in the plot below, figure \ref{phase}. The values of the phases are presented in degrees and the frequency is also presented in logarithmic scale.

\label{phase}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

The plot obtained for phases is also similar to the one obtained in the theoretical analysis, shown in Figure \ref{fig6}. Therefore, the reason for the changes in phases are the same that are presented in \ref{sec2.6}
