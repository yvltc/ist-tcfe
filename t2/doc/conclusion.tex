\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Looking at the results shown in table \ref{op:tab_4} and \ref{op:tab_5} and comparing them to the theoretical analysis present in tables \ref{tab2} and \ref{tab3}, it is clear that the \emph{NgSpice} simulation results were equal to the values predicted by the methods applied. As the "experimental" results are merely a simulation based on the same theoretical models used in this report, it is not surprising that this is the case. The circuit is a first order system (current and voltage sources, resistors and a capacitor) and therefore the manipulated equations were linear and first order linear differential equations. Symbolic calculations were required to compute and solve them in a mathematical software like \emph{Octave}.
